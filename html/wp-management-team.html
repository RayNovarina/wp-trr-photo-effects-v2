<p class="full" style="text-align: justify;">Translarity is built on an innovative idea and the work of many people across multiple organizations. It is a simple idea that has been around for awhile, without anyone being able to capitalize on it due to the extremely technically challenging requirements. The central idea being that, for a large segment of the probe market, a more cost effective probe card can be built from existing technologies. The experienced and applied minds of Translarity employees, their supply chain partners and our customers crossed the first major milestone, in October of 2016. At that point, the cumulative effort of all teams combined helped Translarity achieve its first critical milestone by passing engineering qualification with two of our major customers.</p>
<p class="full" style="text-align: justify;">This success has helped to provide all of us with a renewed commitment and level of effort to meet the increasing challenges that must be addressed to fulfill our customer requirements for production level performance of the Translarity Wafer Translator™. In addition, as we enter into our next challenging phase, it is this shared partnership approach between all of the different skills and organizations, both internal and external, which leverages the strength of each to drive development and continual improvement in performance. By doing so, it helps drive us to meeting our next goals. This has become one of the benchmark elements in our company’s capability and culture.</p>
